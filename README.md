#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

- Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software systems.

- Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. The development of early programming languages such as FORTRAN in the 1950s and C in the 1970s marked a major milestone in software engineering by enabling more complex and 
     efficient software development.
  2. In 1968, the term 'software engineering' was formalized during the NATO Software Engineering Conference, marking the beginning of the field as a distinct discipline focused on the 
     systematic development of software.
  3. The rise of Agile methodologies in the early 2000s revolutionized software engineering by emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability, in contrast to     
     traditional, rigid approaches like the Waterfall model."

- List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Requirements: this involves the process of gathering and documenting informations on user's needs and the system requirements.
  2. Design: after a successful understanding of user's need and system requirement, the creation of a detailed design of a software architecture is implement, coupled the user 
     interface design.
  3. Development: this stage includes the writing of programs and software building according to the detailed structured design.
  4. Testing: a software system cannot be deployed without thorough and rigorous testing. This stage involves conducting various test to ensure that the software meets standard 
     quality and functional requirements.
  5. Deployment: in this stage, the software is made available to users.
  6. Maintenace: deployment is not the final stage of software engineering cycle, as ongoing support and occasional updates are needed to enhance the software and meet further user needs

- Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall and agile methodologies are two prominent software development methodologies with distinct approaches. Waterfall is a linear, sequential process where each phase— 
  requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance—follows the previous one. It’s ideal for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as 
  government contracts or industrial systems. Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative, flexible approach that emphasizes collaboration and adaptability. Development occurs in sprints, 
  allowing for continuous feedback and changes. Agile is well-suited for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, like mobile apps or innovative tech products.

- Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  1. Software developer is responsible for writing programs and implementing software solutions
  2. Quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality of a software by designing and executing software testing plans.
  3. Project manager: a project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

- Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline the software development process by providing a suite of tools, including code editors, debuggers, and compilers, all in one 
  platform. This integration enhances productivity, reduces errors, and simplifies coding. Examples include Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA. Version Control Systems (VCS) are 
  crucial for tracking changes in code, enabling collaboration, and managing different versions of a project. VCS allows multiple developers to work simultaneously while maintaining a 
  complete history of code changes, which is essential for troubleshooting and collaboration. Examples include Git and Subversion (SVN)

- What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  1. Dealing with large codebases in one of the challenges a software engineer faces and this can be overcome by keeping codes modular, well-documented and regularly refactoring to 
     simply and improve organization.
  2. Staying updated with fast-evolving technologies could be bothersome to some software engineers. To overcome this, a software engineer should believe in continous learning, have a 
     GROWTH MINDSET and engage with courses, conferences and tech communities.
  3. Handling tight deadlines is one of the major challenges faced by a software engineer and this can be overcome by leveraging methodologies include scrum and agile, prioritize tasks, 
     and maintaining clear communication with stakeholders.

- Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  1. Unit testing: this include testing the functionality of individual components.
  2. Integration testing: this involves testing interactions between different components or sub-systems.
  3. System testing: this involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
  4. Acceptance testing: this involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure that user needs are met

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


- Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt Engineering involves crafting and optimizing inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models and elicit desired responses. It ensures that AI models understand and 
  generate accurate, relevant outputs, improving the quality and relevance of interactions.

- Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague prompt: what is communicable disease
  Improved version: write a short and succinct note on communicable disease, stating it mode of contact and examples.
